# What's this for?
The field behind my house recently got sold. For as long as I can remember this field had horses in, and I'm worried that some planning application may be made to convert this to a housing estate.


## How does it work?
This repo is a script which will run and check for any planning applications (approved or submitted) relating to my keyword of "Cookley"

## How do I get it to work?
This uses a basic [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with PHP set up to allow the system to work seemlessly on any system.

Install vagrant and clone the repo onto your machine. Run `vagrant up` and then browse to [http://192.168.33.10](http://192.168.33.10).
